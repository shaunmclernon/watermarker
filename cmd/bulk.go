	Short: "Bulk is used to watermark all images in a folder",
	Long: `The "bulk" command is used to watermark multiple images at once. It takes
	two arguments, first a folder containing images to be watermarked, and second
	an image to apply as the watermark. The level of opacity for the watermark image
	can be overwritten with the "--opactiy" or "-o" flag. By default, the watermarked
	images will be saved in a new folder named "watermarked" within the current directory,
	to override the "watermarked" folder name  use the "--name" or "-n" flag and
	provide a name for the new folder.`,
